# UAIMA - Unsolved AI Math Assistant

## Summary

Assist researchers by analyzing ('understanding') previously solved mathematical problems (theorems) in solving yet unsolved problems. The output consists of (steps of) known solved problems that could/should be useful (with a certain amount of probability) in solving your chosen unsolved one.

## Background

Take a look at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_mathematics. Wouldn't it be nice for YOU to solve one (or more!) still open problems and thus become one of the great mathematical geniuses. For example, see _this_ taken from this Wikipedia page (at February 3, 2025: maybe it is solved in the meantime :smirk:)
* The 8<sup>th</sup> of Hilbert's problems (23 challenges in total proposed in 1900): _The Riemann hypothesis ("the real part of any non-trivial zero of the Riemann zeta function is 1/2") and other prime-number problems, among them Goldbach's conjecture and the twin prime conjecture_

## How is it used?

Well... to be honest... I am unsure yet. But a lot of care must be put into creating the data (training) set. How to classify (steps of) known solved mathematical problems? 
* By field?
  * algebra
  * number theory
  * geometry
  * calculus
  * probability
  * ...
* By symbols?
  * $$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$
  * $\sqrt{A \bigcap (B \bigcup C)}$
  * $\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$
  * $\sin ^{\cos{y^2}}$
  * ...

Please feel free to submit your own ideas of classification... the more the merrier!

## How to proceed...
As mentioned before... I have actually no idea (yet) how to proceed. Or if this is even possible. But hey, that's also up to you and your contributing ideas :smile: 
Also, this is part of my course at https://buildingai.elementsofai.com/Conclusion/your-ai-idea, and I think it is out of the box enough!
